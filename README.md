# Chicago Crime Analysis

This project was created in order to develop a model that could predict the types of crime occurring within Chicago. It takes mainly location-based factores and allows a random forest regression model to predict the IUCR, or the crime code, for different locations.

The first file is a set of PowerPoint slides explaining the purpose of the project, why itâ€™s important, as well as statistics and goals for future development. The other file is the code, which imports a CSV file from the Chicago Data Portal to provide the model with a template.

To execute the code, install libraries, mount the Google Drive, upload the CSV file, and run the rest of the code in order.
